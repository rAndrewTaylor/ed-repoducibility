title: 'Analysis of Open Science Practices within Emergency Medicine Journals '

---

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. For the purposes of this paper we will provide a more in depth analysis of the open science practices within the selected emergency medicine journals


We initially performed an Ovid Seach to identify all the articles from 2018 for the selected journals

Two reviewers (KD & TP) then reviewed all articles for reference to open code and open data practices. Articles were considered to have open code and/or open data if References with links

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
